          At its essence, Christian Education is a Bible-based, Holy Spirit-empowered (Christ-centered) teaching and learning process. It aims to guide individuals through all stages of life, using contemporary teaching methods to help them discover and fulfill God's purpose through Christ in every aspect of living.
          We also functions as the Church's quality assurance arm, ensuring the application of Biblical principles across its institutions and departments. It collaborates with various groups and committees to uphold these standards.`}
